# ðŸšš Xpress Bees Delivery Performance Analysis

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing delivery performance and logistics efficiency for **Xpress Bees**, a hypothetical courier and logistics company.  
Using **SQL**, key delivery KPIs were measured to assess **on-time performance, accuracy, cost efficiency, and first-attempt delivery success**.  
The analysis supports data-driven decision-making in **operations and supply chain optimization**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
The main goal was to evaluate and improve the companyâ€™s operational performance through data analytics.  
Key objectives included:
1. Understanding delivery trends and time efficiency.
2. Measuring accuracy and first-attempt success rates.
3. Analyzing transportation costs across regions, carriers, and modes.
4. Providing actionable insights for process improvement.

## ðŸ“Š KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
The following KPIs were calculated to measure operational performance:

1. **On-Time Delivery %**  
   Measures how many orders were delivered on or before the promised date.

2. **Average Delivery Time**  
   Overall and region-wise average time from order to delivery.

3. **Delivery Accuracy %**  
   Percentage of orders successfully delivered to the correct customer without errors.

4. **First Attempt Success (FAS) %**  
   Percentage of deliveries completed successfully in the first attempt.

5. **Transportation Cost Efficiency**  
   Evaluates cost per shipment across region, carrier, and transport mode.

6. **Cost vs Performance Analysis**  
   Combines metrics such as cost, delay, and on-time performance for carrier evaluation.

## ðŸ§  SQL Insights
- Used **aggregate and conditional functions** (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `CASE WHEN`) to derive operational KPIs.  
- Leveraged **GROUP BY** for region, carrier, and transport-level breakdowns.  
- Measured **delivery efficiency and delay patterns** using `DATEDIFF()`.  
- Performed **cost-performance analysis** to compare operational cost and delivery speed.
